How much data do large corporations manage? Tons of it. 
Referring to "tons" of data may be intuitive for paper records, 
but it's an unusual way to describe computer-stored information, 
which is usually measured by character counts and file sizes. 
Still, using ton may give an added sense of how much data a terabyte is. 
To be sure, measuring data by the ton isn't definitive because a disk drive's 
weight doesn't vary significantly over a wide range of storage capacities, but it's
 a handy starting point. A common 8GB hard drive weighs a little more than 1 lb. 
 Figure that the weight of a shared enclosure, power supply and electronics will 
 roughly double the drive's weight, and we can say that 8TB of data is approximately 
 equivalent to 1 ton. That much storage is cumbersome and ungainly.

How does an enterprise deal gracefully and effectively with such unwieldy mountains of 
information? We asked four data-intensive companies - Aetna Inc., The Boeing Co.,
 Atos Origin and AT&T Corp. - to tell us about the problems they faced in managing 
 massive data stores, and how they solved them. For each company, the data is a 
 significant corporate asset resulting from huge investments of time and effort. 
 The data is also the source of many trials and tribulations for the employees who keep
  vigilant watch over it.

While these companies say that good tools are important for managing terabytes of 
information, their IT and database administrators also agree that having a
 clear and comprehensive perspective on the data, via both logical and physical views, 
 is even more critical. Security, data integrity and data availability aren't 
 trivial concerns, they point out, and giving users easy access to the data is a 
 never-ending job.
